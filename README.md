Want to put your JavaScript skills to the test? Join instructor Emma Bostian as she serves up over a dozen JavaScript tasks and walks through the solutions for each. Emma frames each challenge using real-world examples, like setting up a ticking clock in a document, filtering vegetarian dinner options from a menu, and calculating the bill from a trip to a coffee shop. Each challenge is self-contained, so you can watch them in any order, and most solutions are less than two dozen lines of code, so you can quickly learn what you need and move on to the next lesson. Whether you want to learn new ways to use JavaScript or test your existing knowledge, this course can help you sharpen your skills.

This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace.

Each installment of the Level Up series offers at least 15 bite-sized opportunities to practice programming at various levels of difficulty, so you can challenge yourself and reinforce what you’ve learned. Check out the “Using GitHub Codespaces with this course” video to learn how to get a codespace up and running.
